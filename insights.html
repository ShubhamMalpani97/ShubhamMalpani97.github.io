        <h3>Why Chronological Train-Test Split Is Critical in PD Modelling</h3>
        <div class="meta">Model Validation | Regulatory Perspective</div>
        <p>
            In credit risk modelling, random train-test splits can introduce forward-looking bias, 
            especially when behavioural variables evolve over time. A chronological split ensures that 
            models are validated on genuinely unseen future data, reflecting how risk models operate 
            in live portfolio monitoring environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            This approach strengthens backtesting discipline and aligns more closely with regulatory 
            expectations around model stability and out-of-time performance validation.

        <h3>Data Leakage: The Most Underestimated Risk in Credit Models</h3>
        <div class="meta">Feature Engineering | Governance</div>
        <p>
            Data leakage can artificially inflate model performance and create a false sense of predictive power. 
            Variables derived from post-default outcomes, repayment behaviour, or recovery processes may 
            inadvertently embed future information into the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rigorous feature screening using business logic, Information Value checks, and temporal filtering 
            is essential to preserve model integrity and regulatory defensibility.

        <h3>Interpreting Gini and KS Beyond ROC-AUC</h3>
        <div class="meta">Model Performance | Portfolio Risk</div>
        <p>
            While ROC-AUC is commonly referenced, Gini coefficient and KS statistic provide complementary 
            insights into discriminatory power. Gini reflects overall ranking quality, while KS measures 
            separation between good and bad borrowers at the most discriminative cutoff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sustainable performance requires not only high discrimination but also stability over time, 
            particularly under macroeconomic stress conditions.

        <h3>From Theory to Implementation: Translating IFRS 9 Into Code</h3>
        <div class="meta">Expected Credit Loss | Practical Modelling</div>
        <p>
            IFRS 9 requires forward-looking expected credit loss estimation rather than incurred loss recognition. 
            Translating this into code involves integrating PD, LGD, and EAD components while incorporating 
            scenario-based adjustments and macroeconomic overlays.
        </p>
        <p>
            The true challenge is balancing statistical robustness with regulatory transparency and explainability.
